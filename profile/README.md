## Hi @ Cevi Schweiz 👋

🙋‍♀️  We collect all the beautiful and awesome tools which are really helpful for some people in our organisation.

🌈  You wanna contribute? Write an issue or create a pull request in one of our [repository](https://github.com/orgs/cevi/repositories).

💪  Do you wanna be part of this? Contact one of the [public persons](https://github.com/orgs/cevi/people) in the organisation.

🪲  You have found a bug in one of our tools? Please report a new issue.

👩‍💻  You find an overview of all our published and finished (or at least beta) projects on our github overview page: [tbd](https://cevi.tools).

🍿  Did you know that the [YMCA](https://www.ymca.int/) is the biggest youth organisation in the world?

🍿  And did you know that we are part of the biggest ecumenical organisation for women too: the [YWCA](https://www.worldywca.org/)?

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?

🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
